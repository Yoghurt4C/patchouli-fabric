## Important Note
NOTE: This is an experimental, for-fun, and WIP Fabric port of Patchouli.
You will receive NO support at all if you run this.
Please don't bother anyone if you encounter issues running this.

## Why?
* Various issues with the forge ecosystem are tiring me out
* I want to see how Fabric is coming along
* I can't make an educated judgment on Forge vs. Fabric if I haven't used both
* The best way to get so called "educated" is to port a real world use-case to Fabric

## Will this ever get released?
If I get it to work, and not under the official Patchouli banner. It'll be like "Botania Unofficial",
derived from but unaffiliated with the original.
